## Assignment Objective

* Pick Week9 code and add cutout
* Implement LR finder and ReduceLR on Plateau
* Implement GradCam function as a module
* Find Best LR and use SGD with momentum
* Train for 50 epochs
* Show training and test accuracy curves
* Target Accuracy is 88%
* Run Gradcam on 25 misclassified images and show ground truth and predictions for each

## Model Summary

The model reaches a final test accuracy of **90.79%** in **CIFAR-10** dataset in 50 epochs. Target accuracy is reached after 28 epochs.
The model has **11,173,962 parameters**.
